# 🖼️ Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) - Image Mining

This repository contains an implementation of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), a technique for searching and retrieving images based on their visual content rather than metadata or keywords. The project explores feature extraction, similarity measurement, and retrieval techniques to improve image search accuracy.

## 📌 Overview

### 🔍 What is CBIR?

Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is a method that searches images in a database based on visual characteristics such as color, texture, shape, and deep features extracted from images. Unlike traditional text-based search, CBIR enables automatic and efficient image retrieval by analyzing the actual pixel content.

### ✨ Project Highlights
- Feature Extraction: Utilizes handcrafted and deep learning-based features.
- Similarity Measurement: Implements various distance metrics for image comparison.
- Efficient Retrieval: Searches for similar images within a dataset.
- Visualization: Displays query results in a ranked list.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/lmcastanedame/ImageMining_CBIR.git
cd ImageMining_CBIR
